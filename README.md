# Classical_ML_models_from_Scratch

In this project, I Summerized some classical Machine learning models I wrote from scratch.
I used different datasets to analyze the performace of the different models.
The Models I wrote from scratch are: 

- K-means
- KNN
- Linear regression (closed form and gradient discent + L2 reg)
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- ADA Boost
